4/22/2022 Ukraine Rescue: The big tent of the New Federal State of China has the largest LED TV screen in the region to show the footage of our rescue operations. A 6-meter-high billboard was established to display the information about the New Federal State of China, other rescue organizations, and shuttle buses. Some people attacked our fellow fighters as it seems they were not happy with the cause of the New Federal State of China to take down the CCP. We will hold these people accountable for their actions. Heavy rain will be detrimental to the Russian troops!

4/22/2022 乌克兰救援连线：新中国联邦的大帐篷用当地最大的液晶电视来播放救援画面，还竖立了6米高的展示新中国联邦、各救援组织和班车信息的“擎天柱”；有人看新中国联邦灭共不爽而攻击战友，我们会对他们的行为追究到底！天降大雨将对俄军不利！
